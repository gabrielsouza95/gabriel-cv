          🌌 Sou uma pessoa muito curiosa e adoro aprender 🧑‍🔬.
          <br>
          Nos meus projetos busco combinar tudo que gosto de fazer, por exemplo:
          <br>
          - programar embarcados e aplicações web distribuidas.
          <br>
          - projetos de eletrônica e mecânica.
          <br>
          <br>
          Uso meu carro como cobaia do meu processo de aprendizagem de mecânica, fazendo sua
          manutenção e aprimoramentos.
          <br>
          <br>
          Gosto muito de impressão e modelagem 3D. 
          Atuo voluntariamente fazendo manutenção das impressoras 3D do FabLab Bauru

          Como TCC da faculdade, um <a href="https://github.com/gabrielsouza95/CarManGUI">sistema de telemetria para a FEB Racing.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Estou fazendo impressões 3D, aprendendo tudo do zero, inclusive a manutenção da impressora, além de já ter conseguido imprimir com ABS e PLA.
        </p>

        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments 🏅</h2>

        <p>
          Desmontei e montei o motor de um Corsa Wind 8v hatch 4 portas sem ar e nem direção hidráulica com ajuda de muitos companheiros. Foi incrível.
          Além dessa presepada, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/banguela_ocorsa/">fiz várias outras manutenções nele</a> e mais estão sendo feitas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Estou fazendo as manutenções nas impressoras no <a href="https://www.bauru.unesp.br/#!/citeb/fab-lab/">FabLab da Unesp Bauru</a> e aprendendo corte a laser com o pessoal de lá.

        <p>
          My second and last year on the Jr.com company officially, as the team rotates every year.
          <br>
          On my time as marketing director, as the company growth, it had to be restructured, so I developed my team management
          skill.
          <br>
          As a director, I split the tasks to the trainees as the company needs and according to the trainee interests. 
          <br>
          In that year we worked on active propection, changing the visual identity of the company. With the active propection, we received more projects compared to the last year.
          I did events management and the coordination of the team responsible for the events too.
